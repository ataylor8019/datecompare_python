# Problem statement: User should be able to compare two dates in the following 
# format: MM/DD/YYYY
#
# Optionally, the user may input timestamp data in the following format: 
# HH:mm:SS
#
# The program should compare on date values only: it should ignore whether the
# timestamps themselves are different, and compare only on day, month, and 
# year values.
#
# Also, the program should account for basic variation in how single day and 
# month values are input: that is, it should be able to tell that literals 
# such as '01' and '1' represent the same value, and compare them accordingly.
#
#
# Usage: 
# In Windows CMD window: py datecompare_python.py
# In Bash: python3 datecompare_python.py
